XQuery utility to convert MARC/XML Bibliographic records to BIBFRAME resources.


Xquery scripts are provided for MarkLogic, Saxon, and Zorba.


Parameters (HTTP for ml.xqy; external for saxon.xqy; external for zorba.xqy):

	marcxmluri 	- Path to MARC/XML file.  File can be retrieved over 
				  HTTP (begin http://) or from the filesystem.
	baseuri 	- Base URI for generated resources.
	serialization 	- rdfxml, rdfxml-raw, ntriples, json, exhibitJSON  
			  (rdfxml is default)
			  rdfxml=flattened RDF/XML, everything has an identifier
			  rdfxml-raw=Verbose, cascaded output.



Specific Processor Notes

	ml.xqy - intended for the MarkLogic Database and Application 
		Server (http://community.marklogic.com/docs).  This expects an HTTP 
		application server.  Set up an application server with the location 
		of this package 
		as the root and (purely as an example) go to 

	http://hostname:port/ml.xqy?marcxmluri=http://location/of/marcxml.xml&serialization=ntriples&baseuri=http://base-uri/


	saxon.xqy can be used with the Saxon XSLT and Xquery Processoer.  This 
		has been tested using the Saxon processor in Eclipse and Oxygen.  
		Saxon can be run from the command line or through either of the two 
		previously mentioned applications.  For more about Saxon see 
		http://saxon.sourceforge.net/  
	
	java -cp /path/to/saxon9he.jar net.sf.saxon.Query saxon.xqy marcxmluri=/path/to/marc/xml/file baseuri=http://my-base-uri/ serialization=rdfxml


	zorba.xqy can be used with the Zorba Xquery processor.  
		For more about see http://www.zorba-xquery.com/  Run from the 
		command line with:
	
	zorba -i -f -q zorba.xqy -e marcxmluri:="http://location/of/marcxml.xml" -e serialization:="rdfxml" -e baseuri:="http://base/"




Exhibit Display

	To get the Exhibit display to work for the Xquery, set the serialization
	parameter to "exhibitJSON".
	
	The Exhibit JSON output should be saved as a file named
	
		data.json
	
	in the html/data directory.  You can copy and paste this into 
	the correctly named file or, if running the command line, pipe the output 
	to html/data/data.json.
	
	Afterwards, simply open the exhibit.html file in a browser.
	
	Note:  For Zorba and Saxon, you will need to add a runtime parameter
	to the command to instruct the processor to omit the XML declaration.
	
	For Saxon, add: '!method=text'
	E.g.: java -cp /path/to/saxon9he.jar net.sf.saxon.Query saxon.xqy '!method=text' [ other params, as above ]
	
	For Zorba, add: -r
	E,g,: zorba -i -r -f -q zorba.xqy [ other params, as above ]
